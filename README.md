# MegaBulkUploader

**MegaBulkUploader** is a powerful tool designed for bulk uploading files or directories to MEGA.nz using proxy accounts. It automatically generates temporary accounts and uploads data in parallel streams with configurable size limits.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> This was originally built upon Windows, and very loosely tested in linux, so I cannot guarantee support,
> I'd love for some Linux C# developers to make some PRs to get compatibility 100%
